# 🤖 Botcasts

**Hotwire-powered Podcast Player** 🔌

The app starts as a Turbo-less Rails app. The goal is to progressively enhance
it using [Hotwire][].

[Hotwire]: https://hotwired.dev

## Requirements

- Ruby `3.3.0`
- [libvips](https://www.libvips.org/install.html)

## ⚙️ Setup

If this is your first time running the application, run `./bin/setup` to
install dependencies and seed the database.

## 🏗 Running the application

Run `./bin/dev` to start the development server and then navigate to
[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

> [!NOTE]
> Running `./bin/dev` will enqueue background jobs to import the episodes.
> It will take a few minutes.

If you run into issues due to a podcast or episode not being
found when accessing the app, check the jobs statuses
on [http://localhost:3000/good_job](http://localhost:3000/good_job).

## 🚀 Hotwire Essentials: Getting started

Hotwire Essentials is a tutorial that takes you step-by-step through building a functional podcast player that teaches you how to apply Hotwire patterns to solve real-world problems. Each lesson builds on the previous one, with challenges that guide you through Turbo's capabilities, Stiumlus controllers, and best practices for server-driven interactivity.

Once you've setup the application locally, you are ready to start the [lesson plan][].
